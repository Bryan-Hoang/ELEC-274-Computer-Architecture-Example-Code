# JTAGPOLL - Code to handle reading and writing JTAG UART in polled mode.
#
# Author:
# David Athersych, P.Eng. Cynosure Computer Technologies Inc.
#
# HISTORY:
# 170114 DFA	First release, based on code found in Altera documentation
#				and on several websites.  Intended for QECE ELEC274.
# 170222 DFA	Added echo to read character routine.

# Define base address for device, offsets and register masks.

	.equ	OFFSET_DATA,	0			# offset from base for data register

	.equ	WSPACE_MASK,	0xFFFF		# 16 bit mask used to get status bits

	.equ	DATA_IN_MASK,	0x00FF		# input data in bottom byte


#==============================================================================
# Subroutine PutJTAG
# Write character to JTAG output port.  Characters written to this port will
# be displayed on monitor screen.
# Parameters:
#	R2	- contains character to be displayed
# Return value:
#	nothing

	.global	PutJTAG

eggsit:

	ldw		r4, 0(sp)				# restore previous r4 value
	addi	sp, sp, 8				# discard space on stack
	ret					# go back to calling site, all registers preserved

#==============================================================================
# Subroutine GetJTAG
# Read character from JTAG input port.  Characters read from this port will
# also be echoed back, that is, displayed on monitor screen.
# Parameters:
#	none
# Return value:
#	R2	- contains character read

	.global	GetJTAG

GetJTAG:

	ldwio	r2, OFFSET_DATA(r3)	# read JTAG data register
	andi	r4, r2, RVALID		# isolate bit 15 - set when character(s) avail.
	beq		r4, r0, loop3		# if no data, check again
	# character in bottom 8 bits - returned in r2
	andi	r2, r2, DATA_IN_MASK	# data in least significant byte
	# handle echo, so human can see what was typed.  Assume output is ready,
	# (fairly safe assumption if JTAG being used for human input) so just
	# write character to output port
	stwio	r2, OFFSET_DATA(r3)	# write character to data register
	# restore saved registers
